***JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:***

- for - loops through a block of code a number of times
- for/in - loops through the properties of an object
- for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
- while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
