### ***There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:***

***1. Inline CSS***

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property. 

***2. Internal CSS***

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

***3. External CSS***

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
