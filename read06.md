# JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?
*JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.*
**JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.**

Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.


### JavaScript First Steps
> Prerequisites:  you don't need any previous JavaScript knowledge, but you should have some familiarity with HTML and CSS. 

**For learn JavaScript Basics (variables + events + functions) watch this** *[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKbtUP87Dk)* 

***And you can check [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)***

### This is Seven data types that are primitives:
- Boolean. true and false.
- null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
- undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
- Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
- BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
- String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"
- Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
and Object

### **Input form and output**

*Creating HTML is cumbersome
Even in such a simple HTML we wanted to create we had to use + several time and the code is quite unreadable. Imagine what would happen if we wanted to build a more complex application where we might want to build a list of items, or even a table. Building the HTML on the fly and the inserting in the DOM would be quite nasty.*

**In the back-end systems written in Perl, Python or Ruby, people have encountered the same problem and the solution was the creation of various templating engines. In a similar way, there are many templating system for JavaScript as well.**
