## What is HTML?
The HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

***The main parts of our element are as follows:***

- The opening tag
- The closing tag
- The content
- The element

## What is Semantics in HTML:

In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code for example in HTML, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page". 


**Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.There are two display values:**
- block 
- inline

*Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.*

### How to make your wireframe in six steps:

- Do your research
- Prepare your research for reference
- Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
- Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
- Add some detail and get testing
- Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
