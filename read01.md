***GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere and you can save your works.This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests.***

* ### What is GitHub Pages?
_GitHub is a "social coding" site. It allows you to upload code repositories for storage in the Git version control system. You can then collaborate on code projects, and the system is open-source by default, meaning that anyone in the world can find your GitHub code, use it, learn from it, and improve on it. You can do that with other people's code too._
