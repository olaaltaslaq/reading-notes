# How you can benefit from a growth mindset 
* growth mindset: 

***The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement***
* fixed mindset:

***in the opposite of the growth mindset  , in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, indicating that success comes from these inherent traits alone, without the need for further development or effort***

### If we can improve our ability to catch up with ourselves in those moments when our brains return to a fixed mindset, we can pull ourselves back into a growth state and be more successful in the end.

1. Challenges
2. Obstacles
3. Effort
4. Criticism
5. The success of others 

#### 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:
* you can choose to seek first to understand
* working to change fixed mindset
* Growing at work, and outside work too
