# Git 
### What is Git?
*Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.*

### Download Git:
*In order to use Git, your computer must have it available. If you already have Git on your computer, you should make sure you have the latest version.*

Git can be installed in three ways:
- Install as a package
- Install via another installer
- Download and compile the source code

## Remote Repositories
*In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network.*

- Cloned Repositories: As mentioned earlier, for cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local branch.
- Seeing Your Remotes: By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
- Adding Remotes:
To create a new remote Git repository with a short name
- Fetching: Fetching entails pulling data that you don’t have from a remote project.
- Pushing: To push your changes “upstream” for sharing
- Renaming Remotes: To rename a remote’s short name, use the git remote rename command.
- Removing Remotes: To remove a remote for whatever reason (e.g., a contributor has left the team, the server has moved), simply use the git remote rm command.

### Local Repository Structure
***The local Git repository has three components:***

1. Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
2. Index: The area used for staging
3. Head: Points to the most recent commit
