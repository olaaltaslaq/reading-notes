### What is Git?
*Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.*

### Local Repository Structure
***The local Git repository has three components:***

- Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
- Index: The area used for staging
- Head: Points to the most recent commit
