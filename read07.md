# Programming with JavaScript
### **Control flow**
*The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.*

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

**conditional structure:**

### **Operators**
*JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.*

### **Expressions**
*An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.*
JavaScript has the following expression categories:

- Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)
- String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)
- Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)
- Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
- Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.

### **Functions**
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

### **JavaScript Function Syntax:**
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
