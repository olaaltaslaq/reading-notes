## Introduction:

It written with two very different types of people:

● Those who want to learn how to design and build websites
from scratch.

● Anyone who has a website (that may be built using a
content management system, blogging software, or an
e-commerce platform) and wants more control over the
appearance of their pages.

> The only things you need in order to use this book are a
computer with a web browser and a text editor (such as
Notepad, which comes with Windows, or TextEdit, which
comes with Macs).

## Structure:

In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to
structure documents. 

#### How HTML describes the structure of a web page?
The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video). This is
illustrated on the right with a
copy of a newspaper alongside
the corresponding article on its
website

*(Structure of an HTML Document)*

An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts: 
 
●HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data etc.

●BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.

#### How tags or elements are added to your document?

An HTML tag is commonly defined as a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a Web page. At the core of HTML, tags provide the directions or recipes for the visual content that one sees on the Web.

## Extra Markup:
**Specifying different versions of HTML**

Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML.

- HTML 4 (Released 1997)

HTML4 is the first version to include cascading style sheets as part of the HTML standard - HTML4 is now reliant on style sheets to provide precise control of data within the page.

- XHTML 1.0 (Released 2000)

Extensible HyperText Markup Language is part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used HyperText Markup Language, the language in which Web pages are formulated.

***In order to help web page authors move to this new syntax, two main flavors of XHTML 1.0 were created:***

-*Strict XHTML 1.0, where authors had to follow the rules to the letter*

-*Transitional XHTML 1.0, where authors could still use presentational elements (such as <center> and <font>).*

- HTML5 (Released 2000)

HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.


**Comments, meta information and iframes**

- comment Tag: 

The <! -- --> is an HTML comment tag.
To comment out in HTML, insert information between <! -- and --> tags (browsers won't show these notes).
Commenting in HTML allows developers to leave notes about their code, its functionality or to indicate necessary changes for the future.

- meta Tag: 

The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).

- iframe Tag: 

The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
