# HTML

![html](https://www.arageek.com/wp-content/uploads/html5-intro.jpg) 

## Introduction:

The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

It written with two very different types of people:

● Those who want to learn how to design and build websites
from scratch.

● Anyone who has a website (that may be built using a
content management system, blogging software, or an
e-commerce platform) and wants more control over the
appearance of their pages.

> The only things you need in order to use this book are a
computer with a web browser and a text editor (such as
Notepad, which comes with Windows, or TextEdit, which
comes with Macs).

## Structure:

In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to
structure documents. 

#### How HTML describes the structure of a web page?
The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video). This is
illustrated on the right with a
copy of a newspaper alongside
the corresponding article on its
website

*(Structure of an HTML Document)*

An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts: 
 
●HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data etc.

●BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.

#### How tags or elements are added to your document?

An HTML tag is commonly defined as a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a Web page. At the core of HTML, tags provide the directions or recipes for the visual content that one sees on the Web. 

*EXAMPLES:*

#### How to Write your first web page?

Step 1: Open Your Text Editor

Step 2: Write Your HTML Skeleton

Step 3: Save Your File

Step 4: Open Your Web Page in Your Browser

## Extra Markup:
**Specifying different versions of HTML**

Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML.

- HTML 4 (Released 1997)

HTML4 is the first version to include cascading style sheets as part of the HTML standard - HTML4 is now reliant on style sheets to provide precise control of data within the page.

- XHTML 1.0 (Released 2000)

Extensible HyperText Markup Language is part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used HyperText Markup Language, the language in which Web pages are formulated.

***In order to help web page authors move to this new syntax, two main flavors of XHTML 1.0 were created:***

-Strict XHTML 1.0, where authors had to follow the rules to the letter

-Transitional XHTML 1.0, where authors could still use presentational elements (such as < center > and < font >).

- HTML5 (Released 2000)

HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.


**Comments, meta information and iframes**

- comment Tag: 

The <! -- --> is an HTML comment tag.
To comment out in HTML, insert information between <! -- and --> tags (browsers won't show these notes).
Commenting in HTML allows developers to leave notes about their code, its functionality or to indicate necessary changes for the future.

- meta Tag: 

The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).

- iframe Tag: 

The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.

An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.


## HTML5 Layout:

**HTML5 layout elements**

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

![html5](https://www.powerfaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Difference-between-HTML-and-HTML5.jpg) 

**How old browsers understand new elements**

Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to
help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS on the
left which states which new elements should be rendered as
block-level elements.

## Process & Design:

Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

-Target Audience: individuals
● What is the age range of your target audience?
● Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
● Which country do your visitors live in?
● Do they live in urban or rural areas?
● What is the average income of visitors?
● What level of education do they have?
● What is their marital or family status?
● What is their occupation?
● How many hours do they work per week?
● How often do they use the web?
● What kind of device do they use to access the web?

-Target Audience: Companies
● What is the size of the company or relevant department?
● What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
● Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
● How large is the budget they control?

**WireFrames**

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require. A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. 

*EXAMPLE:*

**Getting your message across using design**

The primary aim of any kind of visual design
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.


**Visual hierarchy**

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find
information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

# JavaScript

![javas](https://blog.desafiolatam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/JS.png) 

## Introduction:

JavaScript is a programming language we can use to make a website interactive. When we search something on Google or click a link, our website changes — that’s what JavaScript allows us to do.

**How to Make Interactive Websites with JavaScript**

1- ACCESS CONTENT:

You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of emai 1 


2- MODIFY CONTENT:

You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an
<img> element

3- PROGRAM RULES :

You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport). 

4- REACT TO EVENTS:

You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading 

*EXAMPLE:*

![jse](https://www.formget.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/javascript-set-form-action-example.png)


## The ABC of Programming:

A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS: A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

**WRITING A SCRIPT**

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

1: DEFINE THE GOAL:
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.

2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT:
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.

3: CODE EACH STEP:
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

**The Browser Object Model**

Almost all web browsers support JavaScript and all of those browser will have a set of built in objects which can be accessed by developers to manipulate the page. This is called the Browser Object Model or BOM for short, and it’s series of APIs that can be used by developers to write their web apps.

**HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE?**

In order to understand how you can change the content of an HTML
page using JavaScript, you need to know how a browser interprets the
HTML code and applies styling to it. 

1: RECEIVE A PAGE AS
HTML CODE 

2: CREATE A MODEL OF
THE PAGE AND STORE
IT IN MEMORY

3: USE A RENDERING
ENGINE TO SHOW THE
PAGE ON SCREEN 

> All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your
instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow. 


**HOW HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER?** 

- An HTML file contains the structure of the page itself. It is kind of like the structure of the building.

- A CSS file contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colors, positioning and more. It is kind of like the design of the building itself.

- A JavaScript file determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page. It determines what happens when users click, hover or type within certain elements. This is kind of like the functionality of the building.

**LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE**

To include an external JavaScript file, we can use the script tag with the attribute src . You've already used the src attribute when using images. The value for the src attribute should be the path to your JavaScript file. This script tag should be included between the <head> tags in your HTML document.
